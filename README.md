# Glaser Mesh processing scripts

some scripts to process squeeze scans from the [glaser projects](https://digital-humanities.at/en/dha/s-project/3d-digitizing-glaser-squeezes) for archival and dissemination
most of this requires [Meshlab](http://www.meshlab.net/#download) and [Nexus](http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/nexus/) to work.
